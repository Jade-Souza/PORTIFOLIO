      description:
        "This project strengthened my understanding of genetic algorithms and optimization techniques. It also provided practical experience with population-based search, fitness functions, selection, crossover, mutation and the analysis of algorithmic complexity. The experiments demonstrated how parameters such as search-space limits, population size and number of generations directly affect the behavior and quality of the solution."
